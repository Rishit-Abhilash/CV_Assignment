## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.8+
pip install tensorflow>=2.10.0
pip install keras>=2.10.0
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
pip install nibabel  # For reading NIfTI files
pip install openpyxl  # For reading Excel
pip install pillow opencv-python
```

### Running the Notebooks

Execute notebooks in order:

1. **00_utils_and_config.ipynb** - Load all utilities (run this first in each notebook)
2. **01_data_preparation.ipynb** - Extract 2D slices from 3D NIfTI volumes
3. **02-06** - Train each of the 5 models independently
4. **07_results_comparison.ipynb** - Compare all models

### Example: Training Model 3 (Best Model)

```python
# In Jupyter notebook
%run 00_utils_and_config.ipynb

# Load preprocessed data
X_train = np.load('processed_data/X_train_128.npy')
X_test = np.load('processed_data/X_test_128.npy')
y_train = np.load('processed_data/y_train.npy')
y_test = np.load('processed_data/y_test.npy')

# Build and train CNN-LSTM model
# (See notebook 04 for complete implementation)
```

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing (4 Steps from Paper 2)

- **Step 1: Resize** - Convert to 224×224 or 128×128
- **Step 2: Labeling** - Binary labels from CDR scores (0=Non-Demented, 1=Demented)
- **Step 3: Normalization** - Rescale pixels from [0, 255] to [0, 1]
- **Step 4: Color Modification** - Convert grayscale to RGB (3-channel)

### 2. Data Augmentation (Models 2-5)

- Random rotations: 0-90 degrees
- Random horizontal/vertical flips
- Random zoom/magnification
- Random spatial shifting

### 3. Model Architectures

#### Model 1 & 2: CNN (13 layers)
```
Input → Conv2D(16) → MaxPool → Conv2D(32) → MaxPool → Dropout(0.25)
→ Conv2D(64) → MaxPool → Dropout(0.20) → Flatten
→ Dense(128) → Dense(64) → Dense(2, Softmax)
```

#### Model 3: CNN-LSTM (7 layers) ⭐
```
Input(1, 128, 128, 3) → TimeDistributed(Conv2D(64)) → TimeDistributed(MaxPool)
→ TimeDistributed(Conv2D(32)) → TimeDistributed(MaxPool)
→ TimeDistributed(Flatten) → LSTM(100) → Dense(2, Sigmoid)
```

#### Model 4: CNN-SVM (6 layers)
```
Input → Conv2D(64) → MaxPool → Conv2D(32) → MaxPool
→ Flatten → Dense(2, L2 reg) + SVM → Softmax
```

#### Model 5: VGG16-SVM
```
Pre-trained VGG16 → Flatten → SVM (Linear kernel) → Dense(2, Softmax)
```

### 4. Evaluation Metrics (from Paper 2)

- **Accuracy** = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN)
- **F1-Score** = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Specificity** = TN / (TN + FP)
- **Training Time** (seconds)
- **Testing Time** (milliseconds)

## Results

### Model Performance (Achieved)

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Specificity | Train Time (s) |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| CNNs-without-Aug ⭐ | **98.45%** | 98.57% | 97.96% | 98.26% | 98.84% | 443.5 |
| CNN-LSTM-with-Aug | 97.99% | 97.57% | 97.96% | 97.76% | 98.01% | 108.1 |
| CNNs-with-Aug | 66.64% | 69.69% | 45.42% | 54.99% | 83.91% | 474.7 |
| CNN-SVM-with-Aug | 56.31% | 84.21% | 3.26% | 6.27% | N/A | N/A |
| VGG16-SVM-with-Aug | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Note:** Models 2 and 4 did not achieve the expected performance from Paper 2. Model 1 (CNNs-without-Aug) achieved the best results with 98.45% accuracy.

### Comparison with Paper 2 Targets

| Model | Achieved | Paper 2 Target | Difference |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------|
| CNNs-without-Aug | 98.45% | 99.22% | -0.77% |
| CNN-LSTM-with-Aug | 97.99% | 99.92% | -1.93% |
| CNNs-with-Aug | 66.64% | 99.61% | -32.97% |
| CNN-SVM-with-Aug | 56.31% | 99.14% | -42.83% |
| VGG16-SVM-with-Aug | - | 98.67% | Not trained |

### Key Findings

**Best Performing Model:** CNNs-without-Aug (98.45% accuracy)
- Achieved 98.45% accuracy with 98.84% specificity
- Training time: 443.5 seconds
- Strong precision (98.57%) and recall (97.96%)
- F1-Score: 98.26%

**CNN-LSTM Model:** Second best (97.99% accuracy)
- Faster training time (108.1s vs 443.5s)
- Good balance of all metrics
- Most efficient model in terms of accuracy per training time

**Underperforming Models:**
- CNNs-with-Aug and CNN-SVM-with-Aug significantly underperformed
- May require hyperparameter tuning or additional training epochs
- Dataset differences may have contributed to lower performance

### Recent Improvements (Overfitting Fixes)

**All models have been updated with the following improvements:**

1. **Early Stopping** - Automatically stops training when validation loss stops improving
   - Model 1: patience=15 epochs (expected to stop around epoch 56-70 vs. original 100)
   - Model 2: patience=15 epochs
   - Model 3: patience=7 epochs (expected to stop around epoch 11-18 vs. original 25)

2. **Learning Rate Scheduling** - Reduces learning rate when validation plateaus
   - Model 1: Already had ReduceLROnPlateau ✓
   - Model 2: Added ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=5, factor=0.5)
   - Model 3: Added ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=3, factor=0.5)

3. **Proper Train/Val Split**
   - Model 2: Fixed to use 80/20 train/val split instead of evaluating on test set during training

**Expected Improvements After Retraining:**
- Model 1: Same accuracy (98.45%), but ~40% faster training time
- Model 2: Significant accuracy improvement expected (66% → 90-95%+) due to proper validation
- Model 3: Slight accuracy improvement (97.99% → 98.5%+), much faster training

**Note:** These improvements maintain Paper 2's methodology while fixing implementation issues and preventing overfitting. Retraining required to see results.
